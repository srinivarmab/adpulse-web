      <p style={p}>
        AdPulse AI respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your data.
        This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it,
        and how we protect it.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2}>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p style={p}>
        We may collect your name, email address, website information, and any
        information you submit through our forms. If you connect a Google Ads
        account in the future, we may also collect Google Ads performance data
        needed to provide our analysis and recommendations.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2}>How We Use Information</h2>
      <p style={p}>
        We use your information to provide ad performance insights, identify
        wasted spend, generate optimization recommendations, respond to inquiries,
        and improve our services.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2}>Google API Services</h2>
      <p style={p}>
        When Google Ads integration is enabled, AdPulse AI will access only the
        Google Ads data necessary to provide campaign analysis, reporting, and
        optimization recommendations. We do not sell Google user data to third
        parties.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2}>Data Security</h2>
      <p style={p}>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect your
        data. However, no online service can guarantee complete security.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2}>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p style={p}>
        We may use trusted third-party services such as hosting, analytics,
        payment processors, form handling, and communication tools to operate the
        platform.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2}>Your Rights</h2>
      <p style={p}>
        You may contact us to request updates or deletion of your information,
        subject to legal and operational requirements.
